The main objective of this project is to visualize and interpret the collected salary data, highlighting trends and differences observed between racial groups and countries. We aim to utilize advanced data visualization techniques to present this data in a clear and informative manner, thus allowing for a deep understanding of salary disparities without necessarily proposing solutions or recommendations.
In a world where data plays an increasingly important role, the analysis and visualization of salary data become valuable tools for understanding economic and social dynamics. This project focuses on collecting and analyzing salary data based on different things like (gender, age, posts, country...), to better understand variations in compensation across different populations and geographical regions.
